This is a **Python** implementation of creating GIF image from a collection of static images (e.g., PNG).

## Functions

- Create GIF image with each frame has the **same** duration time.

- Create GIF image with the first and the last frame have **different** (long) duration time.

## Usage

1. Specify settings in ```run_GIFCreator.py``` (see instruction on line 6~12).

2. Run ```run_GIFCreator.py``` in Python IDEs or execute the following command in Terminal.
```bash
~$ python run_GIFCreator.py
```

3. The created GIF image will be saved in pre-specified folder (e.g., ```Img_Frames/```).

## Demonstration

- GIF image with **SAME** frame duration time.
