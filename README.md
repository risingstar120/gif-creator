This is a **Python** implementation of creating GIF image from a collection of static images (e.g., PNG images).

## Function

- Creating GIF image with each frame having the **same** duration time.

- Creating GIF image with the first and the last frames having **different** (long) duration time.

## Usage

1. Prepare a series of static images (with ordered names) in a folder (e.g., ```Img_Frames/```).

2. Specify user settings (e.g., duration time) in ```run_GIFCreator.py``` (see comments for details).

2. Run ```run_GIFCreator.py```.

3. The created GIF image will be saved in the specified folder (i.e., ```Img_Frames/```).

## Demonstration

- GIF image with **SAME** frame duration time.
