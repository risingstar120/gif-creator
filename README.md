- Create GIF image with each frame having the **same** duration time.

- Create GIF image with the first frame and the last frame having **different** (long) duration time.

## Usage

1. Prepare a collection of static images (with ordered names) in a folder (e.g., ```Img_Frames/```).

2. Specify user settings in ```run_GIFCreator.py``` (see comments for details).

2. Run ```run_GIFCreator.py```.

3. The created GIF image will be saved in specified folder (i.e., ```Img_Frames/```).
